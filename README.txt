Lonely Planet is a platformer where you have to feed a planet with baddies until it lets you escape in your small rocket ship. Levels of increasing difficulty give you excuses to jam at your keyboard in a desperate attempt not to get crunched into bloody pieces by the flock of baddies. You'll have no choice but to ride them if you want to attain the high places where you rocket ship might have hidden! 

============= 
Game controls 
============= 

Left/Right arrow = walk 
Space = jump 
Backspace = try a level again 

===================== 
Level editor controls 
===================== 

F12 = switch editor mode on/off 

--------------- 
In idle mode 
--------------- 

F1 = load level (esc to cancel, enter to confirm) 
F2 = save level 
F3 = rename level 
F4 = change minimum kills to win 
F5 = change welcome message 
F6 = change win message 
F7 = change next level (enter "<win>" for last level) 

---------------- 
In drop mode 
---------------- 

Left/right arrow cycle between droppables 
Right click also cycles between droppables 
Left click drops 

Start and end points are unique, you can drag them around as 
you want (useful for end point to position the rocket ship right) 

Vacuums are oriented, click to position, hold and drag to rotate 
it the way you want. 

Swarms can be sized however you want, click to position, hold and 
drag to change the radius however you want. 

In decor mode, use 'F1' to choose your own svg file. There's no way 
to move a decor once dropped, sorry (we had to edit json files by hand, 
it's pretty cool) 

=================== 
Config file 
=================== 

You can adjust the resolution with screenX/screenY, 
and change the initial level (see comments) in alone.config
