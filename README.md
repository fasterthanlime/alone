## Well hi there!

This is an experimental (you're used to this word with me by now, aren't you?) entry for Ludum Dare 22. I've always wanted to make an entry to that contest, and today I was like FUCK YEAH I feel like doing ooc all night, so there we go.

## How to build it?

Clone it, go to libs/, clone the following:

  * https://github.com/nddrylliog/zombieconfig
  * https://github.com/nddrylliog/ooc-gdk
  * https://github.com/nddrylliog/ooc-gtk
  * https://github.com/nddrylliog/ooc-cairo
  * https://github.com/fredreichbier/deadlogger

Then source "devrc" (or just export OOC\_LIBS=path-to-alone/libs),
hit `rock -v` in the root directory and you're good to go!

## What is there to play?

Nothing yet!

(Patches welcome!)

(lol.)
